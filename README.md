code
  - 3 func:
    - inintialize: array for loop call the other two funcs,update -> estimate
      -   Juni thinks->given local parameters, wants to know whats around, thats why returning array?
    - update: scan world, where you are -> update, change the particle
      -   Juni thinks->change the weight of the partical around it by scanning and sampling, get the distrubution????
